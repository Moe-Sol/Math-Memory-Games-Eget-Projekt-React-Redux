This work is about making a memory game that helps young children learn the multiplication table in a fun and easy way.
The difference in this game from its math memory game counterparts on the Internet and mobile phones is that it is built differently. Unlike other similar games that shuffle all playing cards together within one space, this game creates two separate spaces. 
The first space is the result of the multiplication operation, and the second space is the multiplication factors, and I think this can make the game more fun and easier to play, where in this case the child will know that there are two sides to the game, each containing a special type of playing cards. This can even help the child get more of the desired benefit from this game.
The second thing here is that the rest of the similar free games I have found online are full of annoying ads that are sometimes not suitable for children which can make this game more popular for parents when I can make it available and free for anyone online without ads and perhaps develop it further.
The programmatic result of the project went as planned, as the game works as required without any problems.
In this work I use the React framework for the programming language JavaScript in addition to some of its libraries as Redux , Hooks, Sass ..
